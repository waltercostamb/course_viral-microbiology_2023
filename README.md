# Advanced Module "Viral Microbiology": Part B

This repository contains information about Part B of the advanced module "Viral Microbiology". The module is part of the Masters program in Microbiology of the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena. The module "Viral Microbiology" is divided into two parts: A, wet lab and B, dry lab. Part B is consisted of 60 hours dry lab work to be completed in two weeks. Theory will be covered in the mornings and practice in the afternoons. We will focus on Computational Biology/Bioinformatics applied to bacteriophages. The following topics will be covered:  

- Introduction to Computational Biology
- Documentation and Lab Book
- Sequence assembly
- Classification of phages
- Sequence annotation

At the end of this module the student should be able to:

- know basic concepts of Computational Biology
- assemble bacteriophage genome sequences from raw data;
- classify bacteriophages;
- annotate genomes;
- document dry lab work in a reproduceable way;
- present a cross-disciplinary scientific project.

The evaluation of the student will be based on:

- Wet lab activities (to be defined by the wet lab teachers): 25%
- Dry lab activities: 25%
  - quality of documentation and reproducibility of experiments as seen in the student's Lab Book. The Lab book should contain commented scripts and a summary of the student's activities throughout the module
- Presentation of the final project: 50%
